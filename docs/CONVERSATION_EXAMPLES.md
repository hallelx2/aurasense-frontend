## 🎙️ Voice Authentication & Onboarding

```
🎤 Aurasense: "Welcome to Aurasense! I'm here to help you discover great food through voice. What's your name?"

🗣️ Sarah: "Hi, I'm Sarah. I'm excited to try this voice-first approach."

🎤 Aurasense: "Great to meet you, Sarah! I'll help you find food that's perfect for your needs. Tell me about any dietary restrictions or health considerations I should know about."

🗣️ Sarah: "I have celiac disease, so I need strictly gluten-free options. I'm also vegetarian."

🎤 Aurasense: "Thank you for sharing that, Sarah. I'll make sure to only recommend restaurants with certified gluten-free options and vegetarian menus. Your health and safety are my top priority. Let me send you an email with a verification sentence to set up your secure voice profile."

🗣️ Sarah: "Perfect! I love that you focus on safety first."

🎤 Aurasense: "Safety is everything when it comes to food allergies. I've sent the verification to your email. Once you read that sentence back to me, we'll have your voice profile set up and I can start helping you find amazing, safe food options."
```

### **Scenario 2: Voice Authentication - Returning User Marcus**

🗣️ Marcus: "I'm craving something I haven't tried before. Something with a kick to it."

🎤 Aurasense: "I have the perfect place for you! There's a new Korean restaurant called 'Seoul Fire' that just opened.

### **Scenario 3: Health-Conscious Food Discovery - Janet**
```
🗣️ Janet: "I'm hungry and need something healthy. I'm diabetic and trying to watch my carbs."

🎤 Aurasense: "I understand, Janet. Let me find you some excellent low-carb options that will keep your blood sugar stable. I recommend 'Fresh Garden' - they specialize in diabetic-friendly meals with clearly marked carb counts."

🎤 Aurasense: "They have grilled salmon with steamed vegetables (8g carbs), chicken Caesar salad without croutons (6g carbs), and a cauliflower rice bowl with grilled chicken (12g carbs). All their meals are prepared by a chef who's also diabetic, so they really understand the importance of accurate nutritional information."

🗣️ Janet: "The salmon sounds perfect! Do they really have accurate carb counts?"

🎤 Aurasense: "Absolutely! Fresh Garden is certified by the American Diabetes Association for their accurate nutritional labeling. They work with a registered dietitian to ensure all their carb counts are precise. The grilled salmon comes with a detailed nutritional breakdown, and they can adjust portion sizes if needed."

🗣️ Janet: "That's exactly what I need. Can you place the order?"

🎤 Aurasense: "I'll place the order for the grilled salmon with steamed vegetables. I'm also adding a note about your diabetes so they take extra care with preparation. Your order will be ready in 25 minutes. I'll send you the nutritional details to your phone."

🗣️ David: "That sounds amazing. What do they have available?"

🎤 Aurasense: "They have grilled chicken breast with quinoa, beef stir-fry with vegetables, and turkey meatballs with marinara sauce. All are prepared in their certified nut-free kitchen. Would you like me to call ahead to confirm your allergy requirements?"

🗣️ David: "Yes, please! I'll take the chicken breast."

🎤 Aurasense: "I'm calling them now to confirm your severe peanut allergy requirements... They've confirmed they'll prepare your meal with extra precautions in their nut-free section. Your order will be ready in 30 minutes, and I'll send you the ingredient list and their allergy certification."
```

### **Scenario 5: Group Dining Coordination - Maria**
```
🗣️ Maria: "I need to organize dinner for 6 people tonight. We have someone with gluten sensitivity, a vegetarian, and one person who's lactose intolerant."

🎤 Aurasense: "That's a great mix of dietary needs, Maria. I can find a restaurant that accommodates everyone safely. Let me suggest 'Inclusive Eats' - they specialize in multi-dietary group dining with separate prep areas for different dietary needs."

🗣️ Maria: "That sounds promising, but will everyone be happy with the food quality?"

🎤 Aurasense: "Absolutely! Inclusive Eats has a unique approach - they have dedicated stations for gluten-free, vegetarian, and dairy-free preparations, but they focus on making every dish delicious regardless of dietary restrictions. Their reviews consistently praise both the safety protocols and the taste."

🗣️ Maria: "Can they accommodate 6 people at 7 PM tonight?"

## 🤝 Social & Community Conversations

### **Scenario 8: Community Building - Sarah**
```
🗣️ Sarah: "I'm feeling a bit isolated with my celiac disease. Are there other people with similar dietary restrictions I could connect with?"

🎤 Aurasense: "I completely understand that feeling, Sarah. Actually, there's a great community of people with celiac disease in your area. There's Jessica, who also has celiac and loves finding new gluten-free restaurants, and Tom, who's been gluten-free for 5 years and knows all the best spots."

🗣️ Sarah: "That sounds wonderful! How do you know they'd be interested in meeting?"

🗣️ Sarah: "I'd love to meet them! When would work?"

🎤 Aurasense: "I'll check everyone's availability and suggest this weekend for a group meal at 'Gluten-Free Haven' - a restaurant you all love. I can also invite a few others from the celiac community who might be interested. Building connections over safe, delicious food!"

🗣️ Sarah: "That sounds perfect! I've been wanting to try that restaurant."

🎤 Aurasense: "I'm creating a group chat for 'Gluten-Free Friends' and sending invitations for weekend brunch. I'll also suggest making it a monthly tradition - first Saturday of each month, different certified gluten-free restaurant each time. Community building through safe dining!"
```

### **Scenario 9: Health Support Network - Michael**
```
🎤 Aurasense: "Michael, I noticed you're managing diabetes and looking for support. There's a local diabetes support group that meets monthly for healthy dining experiences. They're planning a diabetes-friendly restaurant tour next week. Interested?"

🗣️ Michael: "That sounds really helpful! I've been struggling to find restaurants that understand diabetic needs."

🎤 Aurasense: "The group is led by Tom, a certified diabetes educator who also has type 2 diabetes. He organizes visits to restaurants that specialize in diabetic-friendly meals with accurate carb counts. The group shares tips and supports each other's health goals."

## 🚨 Emergency & Health Scenarios

### **Scenario 10: Allergy Emergency Prevention - Lisa**
```
🗣️ Lisa: "I'm at a restaurant that says they can accommodate my shellfish allergy, but I'm not confident about their safety protocols."

🎤 Aurasense: "Lisa, your safety is paramount. What restaurant are you at, and what did they tell you about their allergy protocols?"

🗣️ Lisa: "I'm at 'Seaside Grill' downtown. They said they can make shellfish-free dishes, but when I asked about cross-contamination, the server seemed unsure."

🎤 Aurasense: "I'm checking their allergy certification now... I see they have basic allergy awareness training but no dedicated shellfish-free prep area. Given your severe allergy, I don't recommend eating there. Let me find you a safer option immediately."

🗣️ Lisa: "Thank you! I was getting worried. What do you suggest?"

🎤 Aurasense: "There's 'Allergy-Safe Seafood' just 3 blocks away - they have a completely separate kitchen for shellfish-free meals, certified allergy protocols, and excellent reviews from customers with severe shellfish allergies. I can call ahead to prepare a safe meal for you."

🗣️ Lisa: "Please do that! And can you save this information so I don't end up in this situation again?"

🎤 Aurasense: "Absolutely. I'm updating your profile with 'Seaside Grill' marked as unsafe due to inadequate allergy protocols. I'll prioritize only certified shellfish-free restaurants for future recommendations. I'm calling Allergy-Safe Seafood now to arrange your safe meal."
