  Lottie Performance:
    - Average file size: 10-50KB for food animations
    - Render performance: 60fps on mobile devices
    - Memory usage: 2-5MB for complex animations
    - Recommendation: Lazy load and compress for optimal performance

Voice Processing Benchmarks:
  - Web Audio API latency: 20-50ms on modern browsers
  - Speech recognition accuracy: 95% for clear speech
  - Mobile optimization: Use AudioWorklet for better performance
  - Battery impact: Minimal with proper optimization
```

This comprehensive UI research provides the foundation for building an accessible, voice-first food ordering experience with excellent performance and usability.
